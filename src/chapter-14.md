The first step in creating your own ultimate interview plan is to identify your strengths and weaknesses. Take some time to reflect on your skills, experience, and personality traits, and be honest with yourself about areas where you may need improvement. Consider asking for feedback from mentors, colleagues, or friends to gain an outside perspective.
